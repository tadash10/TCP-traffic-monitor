# TCP-traffic-monitor

## Overview

This Python script is designed for monitoring TCP traffic on a network interface and provides various features for analyzing and managing network packets.

## Features

- Packet capture and analysis
- Logging of captured packets
- Packet filtering based on criteria
- Statistics and analysis of network traffic
- Alerting system for unusual traffic patterns
- Packet payload decoding
- Multithreading for improved performance
- Packet storage options for later analysis
- Configuration management for customizing the script behavior
- Security considerations for running with appropriate privileges
- Integration possibilities with existing security systems
- Visualization of captured data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - pcapy
  - scapy
  - matplotlib (for visualization, if used)
  - Other dependencies as needed

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tcp-traffic-monitor.git
cd tcp-traffic-monitor

markdown


2. Customize the configuration by editing `config.json` with your desired settings.

3. Run the script:

python main.py

graphql


### Configuration

The `config.json` file allows you to configure various aspects of the script, including network interface, filter criteria, logging settings, and more.

### Examples

Here are some common usage examples:

- Monitor traffic on a specific network interface:

python main.py --interface eth0

diff


- Customize filtering criteria:

python main.py --src-ip 192.168.1.1 --dst-ip 8.8.8.8 --protocol TCP

diff


- Enable packet payload decoding:

python main.py --decode-payload


### Security Considerations

Ensure that the script runs with the least necessary privileges. Review and adjust user and group settings as needed in the script.
